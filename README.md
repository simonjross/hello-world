# hello-world
This is my emergence into GitHub. I hope you are all ready

simonjross is my handle and I have been doing some work with OpenDevelopment Mekong. I work as an editor with the teams from Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand at the moment as well as some other things as requested.

Please feel free to say hello any time and help me out.
